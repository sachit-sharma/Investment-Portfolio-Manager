## A System to Track my Stocks

1. **What will my application do?** 

My application will help a user track how much money they have invested in different stocks.On this app, the user would be able to log any new investment or withdrawals they make,along with 
details such as stock name, price, number of units purchased, company type etc. Some features of my app would include 
a visualisation of how much money has been invested in different sectors, calculation of the return on the stock based on the current price given by the user.
It would allow users to view their total profit on all their stocks. 

2. **Who will use it?** 

- People who invest in the stock market.

This app would be most useful for people who regularly make investments in the market and want to diversify their portfolio. This can help them keep track of how much money they have invested in different avenues. 


3. **Why am I doing this?**

This project is of interest to me because as someone who regularly invests money in the stock market, a system to track investments would be incredibly useful to me. 
It would ensure that I am meeting my goals of making regular and diverse investments.  It would also help me plan for the future by predicting how much I might be able to earn on these investments.
