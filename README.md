## A System to Track my Assets

1. **What will my application do?** 

My application will help a user track how much money they have invested in different avenues such as gold, housing, mutual funds and
cryptocurrency. On this app, the user would be able to log any new investment or withdrawals they make,along with 
details such as *when the investment was made, cost price, category of investment, date of maturity* etc.
They would be able to see the proportion of my investments in different categories, calculate the total value of investment in each category and its projected future value (calculated based on interest rate given by the user).


2. **Who will use it?** 

- People who invest in equities
- People who own assets like gold, housing, fixed deposits.

This app would be most useful for people who regularly make investments in the market and want to diversify their portfolio. Even if someone is not regularly investing money, they can use this app to track their fixed assets such as gold, houses and fixed deposits. 


3. **Why am I doing this?**

This project is of interest to me because as someone who regularly invests money in mutual funds, stocks and gold, a system to track investments would be incredibly useful to me. 
It would ensure that I am meeting my goals of making regular and diverse investments. 
It would also help me plan for the future by predicting how much I might be able to earn on these investments.
